C++ không đáp ứng được các yêu cầu này vì C++ cho đem mã nguồn từ máy này sang máy khác nhưng sau khi biên dịch lại hoàn toàn phụ thuộc vào từng bộ vi xử lý cụ thể. Trong khi đó bộ vi xử lý dùng trong các thiết bị điện tử rất đa dạng và có vòng đời khá ngắn ngủi. Nếu ta thay đổi bộ xử lý dẫn đến cần phải thay đổi trình biên dịch C++, điều này gây lên tốn kém. SUN đã thiết kế một ngôn ngữ lập trình mới có tính khả chuyển cao hơn đó chính là Java. Java là tên địa phương nơi xuất xứ của một loại cà phê ngon nổi tiếng. Java được chính thức công bố năm 1995 và ngay lập tức đã tạo lên một trào lưu mới trên toàn thế giới và từ đó đến nay vẫn tạo được sức cuốn hút mạnh mẽ.

Vì Java là một ngôn ngữ lập trình hướng đối tượng, nên phương pháp lập trình trong RMI là phương pháp hướng đối tượng do đó các thao tác hay các lời gọi phương thức đều liên quan đến đối tượng. Ngoài ra, RMI còn cho phép một Client có thể gửi tới một đối tượng đến cho Server xử lý, và đối tượng này cũng có thể được xem là tham số cho lời gọi hàm từ xa, đối tượng này cũng có những dữ liệu bên trong và các hành vi như một đối tượng thực sự. So sánh giữ gọi phương thức từ xa với các lời gọi thủ tục từ xa Gọi phương thức từ xa không phải là một khái niệm mới. Thậm chí trước khi ra đời lập trình hướng đối tượng phần mềm đã có thể gọi các hàm và các thủ tục từ xa. Các hệ thống như RPC đã được sử dụng trong nhiều năm và hiện nay vẫn được sử dụng. Trước hết, Java là một ngôn ngữ độc lập với nền và cho phép các ứng dụng Java truyền tin với các ứng dụng Java đang chạy trên bất kỳ phần cứng và hệ điều hành nào có hỗ trợ JVM. Sự khác biệt chính giữa hai mục tiêu là RPC hỗ trợ đa ngôn ngữ, ngược lại RMI chỉ hỗ trợ các ứng dụng được viết bằng Java. Ngoài vấn đề về ngôn ngữ và hệ thống, có một số sự khác biệt căn bản giữa RPC và RMI. Gọi phương thức từ xa làm việc với các đối tượng, cho phép các phương thức chấp nhận và trả về các đối tượng Java cũng như các kiểu dữ liệu nguyên tố (premitive type). Ngược lại gọi thủ tục từ xa không hỗ trợ khái niệm đối tượng. Các thông điệp gửi cho một dịch vụ RPC (Remote Procedure Calling) được biểu diễn bởi ngôn ngữ XDR (External Data Representation): dạng thức biểu diễn dữ liệu ngoài.

Bản thân các trình quản lý tài nguyên cần phải truy xuất tới các tài nguyên dùng chung được quản lý bởi một tiến trình khác, vì vậy một số tiến trình vừa là tiến trình client vừa là tiến trình server. Các tiến trình phát ra các yêu cầu tới các server bất kỳ khi nào chúng cần truy xuất tới một trong các tài nguyên của các server. Nếu yêu cầu là đúng đắn thì server sẽ thực hiện hành động được yêu cầu và gửi một đáp ứng trả lời tới tiến trình client. Mô hình client/server cung cấp một cách tiếp cận tổng quát để chia sẻ tài nguyên trong các hệ thống phân tán. Mô hình này có thể được cài đặt bằng rất nhiều môi trường phần cứng và phần mềm khác nhau. Các máy tính được sử dụng để chạy các tiến trình client/server có nhiều kiểu khác nhau và không cần thiết phải phân biệt giữa chúng; cả tiến trình client và tiến trình server đều có thể chạy trên cùng một máy tính. Một tiến trình server có thể sử dụng dịch vụ của một server khác. Mô hình truyền tin client/server hướng tới việc cung cấp dịch vụ. Quá trình trao đổi dữ liệu bao gồm: 1.

Lập trình đa tuyến đoạn là một khái niệm quan trọng trong lập trình mạng bằng Java vì các client và server thường phải thực hiện một số tác vụ đồng thời tại cùng một thời điểm (ví dụ lắng nghe các yêu cầu và đáp ứng các yêu cầu, xử lý dữ liệu và cập nhật giao diện đồ họa người dùng).

New abstractions to be covered include NetworkInterface, InterfaceAddress, Inet4/6Address, SocketAddress/InetSocketAddress, Executor, and others; extended access to low-level network information; support for IPv6; more complete access to socket options; and scalable I/O. The example code is also modified to take advantage of new language features such as annotations, enumerations, as well as generics and implicit iterators where appropriate.Most Internet applications use sockets to implement network communication protocols. This book\'s focused, tutorial-based approach helps the reader master the tasks and techniques essential to virtually all client-server projects using sockets in Java. Chapter 1 provides a general overview of networking concepts to allow readers to synchronize the concepts with terminology. Chapter 2 introduces the mechanics of simple clients and servers. Chapter 3 covers basic message construction and parsing. Chapter 4 then deals with techniques used to build more robust clients and servers. Chapter 5 (NEW) introduces the scalable interface facilities which were introduced in Java 1.5, including the buffer and channel abstractions. Chapter 6 discusses the relationship between the programming constructs and the underlying protocol implementations in more detail. Programming concepts are introduced through simple program examples accompanied by line-by-line code commentary that describes the purpose of every part of the program. No other resource presents so concisely or so effectively the material necessary to get up and running with Java sockets programming. Focused, tutorial-based instruction in key sockets programming techniques allows reader to quickly come up to speed on Java applications. Concise and up-to-date coverage of the most recent platform (1.7) for Java applications in networking technology.','src/main/resources/com/chocopi/images/book/20.jpg','Commputers',5,1000000,'Kenneth L.

This process has happened both at the level of mathematical research and at the level of the applications generated by the solution methods that were created. To write a monograph dedicated to a certain domain of mathematical programming is, under such circumstances,especially difficult. In the present monograph we opt for the domain of fractional programming. Interest of this subject was generated by the fact that various optimization problems from engineering and economics consider the minimization of a ratio between physical and/or economical functions, for example cost/time, cost/volume,cost/profit, or other quantities that measure the efficiency of a system. For example, the productivity of industrial systems, defined as the ratio between the realized services in a system within a given period of time and the utilized resources, is used as one of the best indicators of the quality of their operation. Such problems, where the objective function appears as a ratio of functions, constitute fractional programming problem. Due to its importance in modeling various decision processes in management science, operational research, and economics, and also due to its frequent appearance in other problems that are not necessarily economical, such as information theory, numerical analysis, stochastic programming, decomposition algorithms for large linear systems, etc., the fractional programming method has received particular attention in the last three decades.','src/main/resources/com/chocopi/images/book/61.jpg','Commputers',4,1000000,'I.M.

Specifications express information about a program that is not normally part of the program, and often cannot be expressed in a programming lan guage. In the past, the word \"specification\" has sometimes been used to refer to somewhat vague documentation written in English. But today it indicates a precise statement, written in a machine processable language, about the purpose and behavior of a program. Specifications are written in languages that are just as precise as programming languages, but have additional capabilities that increase their power of expression. The termi nology formal specification is sometimes used to emphasize the modern meaning. For us, all specifications are formal. The use of specifications as an integral part of a program opens up a whole new area of programming - progmmming with specifications. This book describes how to use specifications in the process of building programs, debugging them, and interfacing them with other programs. It deals with a new trend in programming - the evolution of specification languages from the current generation of programming languages. And it describes new strategies and styles of programming that utilize specifications. The trend is just beginning, and the reader, having finished this book, will viii Preface certainly see that there is much yet to be done and to be discovered about programming with specifications.','src/main/resources/com/chocopi/images/book/63.jpg','Commputers',4,1000000,'David Luckham',2014,'Springer Science & Business Media'),(64,'PHP Reactive Programming','Leverage the power of Reactive Programming in PHP About This Book Develop an interesting multiplayer browser game written in RxJS and re-implement it using RxPHP Enhance existing reactive applications by building a CLI tool combining Symfony Console Implement Gearman and Rabbit MQ for asynchronous communication Who This Book Is For This book is aimed at people with a solid knowledge of PHP and programming languages in general.

According to the definition provided by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), cybersecurity is the ability to protect or defend against attacks that are made via cyberspace. The totality of cyberspace is composed of several distinct networks of information systems architecture, all of which are interdependent on one another. Internet, telecommunications network, computer systems, embedded systems, and controllers are all examples of networks that fall under this category. In light of this, cybersecurity is concerned with domains such as critical infrastructure, network security, cloud security, application security, the internet of things, and a variety of other domains where the need to guarantee security is of the highest significance. The idea of cyber-physical systems and actual deployments in the real world are at the centre of the security procedures for critical infrastructure. Eavesdropping, compromised key assaults, man in the middle attacks, and denial of service attacks are only some of the sorts of cyber-attacks that may be conducted against sectors such as automation, aviation, healthcare, traffic lights, and electrical grids, amongst others. Other forms of cyber-attacks include: man in the middle attacks, compromised key assaults, and denial of service attacks. Network security is concerned with the measures that are taken to protect information systems, as well as the problems that may develop as a result of those measures. It protects not just the data but also the usefulness and integrity of the network against unauthorised intrusions, hence ensuring the network\'s safety and security. Attacks on computer 2 | P a g e networks can either be passive or aggressive depending on the circumstances. Scanning ports, listening in on conversations, and encrypting data are all examples of passive attacks. Phishing, cross-site scripting, and denial of service are all types of active assaults. Other active attacks include SQL injections.','src/main/resources/com/chocopi/images/book/96.jpg','Commputers',3,1000000,'Dr. Jyoti Parashar',2013,'Xoffencerpublication'),(97,'ROLE OF AI IN CYBERSECURITY','The practises that are outlined in a variety of studys and referred to collectively as \"cyber security\" are intended to safeguard the online presence of a user or an organisation. It is responsible for coordinating the many tools and processes that are necessary to avoid harm to networks, software, and data. Another term for this grouping of technologies and processes is information technology security (IT security). The prominence of the industry is growing as a result of an increased reliance on computer systems such as smartphones, televisions, and the myriad of other tiny devices that comprise the Internet of Things. The internet has made it easier to communicate with people all over the globe in a variety of ways; but it has also presented us with an abundance of new influences that were previously unfathomable. At the same time as the world of security developed, the world of hackers also expanded. Two distinct points of view may be taken into consideration while of cyber security. One advantage is that cloud service providers focus exclusively on this area, which means that their customers can be certain that they are using the most cutting-edge encryption technology currently on the market. In the event of a cyberattack, it is being protected by internet-connected devices, which protect not just the data but also the hardware and software. Organisations take safeguards against hackers and other bad actors by using both cyber security and physical security measures for their data centres and other computerised systems. These procedures are designed to protect against the risk of unauthorised access. The goal of the cyber security subfield known as data security is to maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and accessibility of stored information.

Algorithms that use machine learning can analyse data and figure out what to expect in the future based on what they\'ve learned. In a nutshell, algorithms and models used in machine learning acquire knowledge via repetition and experimentation. Traditional programming entails a computer engineer writing a set of instructions for a computer to follow in order to convert a given set of input data into a specified set of output data. Most commands follow an IF-THEN format: the computer does something when a given condition is satisfied. Yet, computers may learn from their own experiences and solve issues with little human intervention via a process called machine learning. Machine learning & artificial intelligence are often confused, although they are really very distinct. Machine learning is a branch of Al that allows intelligent systems to independently learn new things from data, although Al as a whole refers to robots that can make choices, acquire new skills, and solve problems in a human-like fashion. This book will explain how machine learning may be used on large datasets to provide accurate results that far beyond those of people.

A collection of instructions that must be carried out in order to transform an input into an outcome is referred to as an algorithm. One illustration of this would be the development of an algorithm to produce a classification. Your ordered list is the result, and the input is a series of numerical values to be arranged. You might be interested in discovering the most effective algorithm, which either needs fewer instructions or less memory or both, and you might discover that there are numerous algorithms for the same work. On the other hand, we do not have an algorithm for certain tasks, such as determining what constitutes spam and what constitutes legitimate e-mail. We are aware of the nature of the entry, which is a simple typeface file contained within an email document. We are aware of the expected outcome, which is a yes/no answer signifying whether or not the communication should be considered spam. We are not familiar with the process of converting information to output. The definition of what constitutes spam shifts over time and differs from one individual to the next. Using statistics, we are able to compensate for our dearth of understanding. We are able to quickly collect thousands of example messages, some of which we are aware are spam and would like to \"learn\" more about how they are constructed. Therefore, we would like the computer (machine) to automatically determine the procedure that should be used for this work. There is no need for you to learn how to arrange numbers because we already have algorithms for that; however, there are many applications with example data that do not require an algorithm. Because of developments in computer technology, we are now able to store and analyze large quantities of data, as well as retrieve this data from geographically dispersed locations through the use of a computer network.

Tariffs, antidumping and countervailing duties, government procurement policies, preferential trading arrangements, trade with developing countries and emerging markets, and the World Trade Organization are examined.

It is crucial to understand the impact these global issues have on international trade and what happens to trade when global issues arise. A comprehensive guide of these issues is needed to provide background and understanding about international trade and its relationship with global issues. Global issues occasionally dominate a continuing theme of the international globalized world: global crises, war, security issues, global pandemics such as COVID-19, and trade wars. Global cooperation is required to solve such problems. Economically intellectual thinking will enable the development of guiding policies in solving these global problems.

Impact of Global Issues on International Trade is a critical reference source that uses analytic research to analyze the effects of global economic and financial crises as well as global health crises and their impact on international trade.

Instead, the production process is often split across a number of stages located in countries that are frequently far apart from each other. By spreading out their manufacturing and supply chain activities globally through international investment and intra-firm trade, Multinational enterprises (MNEs) play a focal role in this reorganisation of production. Our ability to understand the global economy, therefore, requires an understanding of the interdependencies between the entities involved in such fragmented production. Traditional methods and statistical approaches are insufficient to address this challenge. Instead, an approach is required that allows us to account for these interdependencies. The most promising approach so far is network analysis. ‘Networks of International Trade and Investment’ makes a case for the use of network analysis alongside existing techniques in order to investigate pressing issues in international business and economics. The authors put forward a range of well-informed studies that examine compelling topics such as the role of emerging economies in global trade and the evolution of world trade patterns. They look at how network analysis, as both an approach and a methodology, can explain international business and economics phenomena, in particular, in relation to international trade and investment. Providing a comprehensive but accessible explanation of the applications of network analysis and some of the most recent methodological advances in its field, this edited volume is an important contribution to research in international trade and investment.','src/main/resources/com/chocopi/images/book/215.jpg','Business',3,1000000,'Matthew Smith',2022,'Vernon Press'),(216,'International Trade and the New Global Economy','In recent decades, the international economy has witnessed profound changes.

Operations and logistics are cornerstones of modern supply chains that in turn are essential for global business and economics. The composition, character and importance of supply chains and networks are rapidly changing, due to technological innovations such as Information and Communication Technologies, Sensors and Robotics, Internet of Things, and Additive Manufacturing, to name a few (often referred to as Industry 4.0). Societal developments such as environmental consciousness, urbanization or the optimal use of scarce resources are also impacting how supply chain networks are configured and operated. As a result, future supply chains will not just be assessed in terms of cost-effectiveness and speed, but also the need to satisfy agility, resilience and sustainability requirements. To face these challenges, an understanding of the basic as well as more advanced concepts and recent innovations is essential in building competitive and sustainable supply chains and, as part of that, logistics and operations. These span multiple disciplines and geographies, making them interdisciplinary and international. Therefore, this book contains contributions and views from a variety of experts from multiple countries, and combines management, engineering as well as basic information technology and social concepts.

An international publication by the two project directors, due to appear at the beginning of 1997, will report on the findings of the project, which involves 26 countries.

All those involved in the broad field of adult education and training will come into contact with many specialist ideas or concepts. It is often assumed of students that they already have a general understanding of these concepts, their meanings, applicability and inter-relationships. This is not always the case. This book examines in detail over forty of these key concepts, ranging from community education and experiential learning to competence and access. It presents a clear, analytical discussion in jargon-free language.

There is social difference with different identities, shifting and transmuting, being forged, and extra-human differences. All these have implications for intra human and human/non-human earth relations. This aspect is not always recognised and valorised. Education, though not an independent variable, still can be mobilised, together with other sources of potential transformation, to redress this situation marked by aggressions, micro and macro, inertia and indifference. It represents a number of immediate challenges for Adult Education. This compendium is intended as a useful resource in this regard. It maps out a kaleidoscope of myriad differences and suggests options for overcoming the various obstacles that stand opposed to those who seek fulfilment in the way they are discursively located. The obstacles are a dent on efforts to living in communion with the rest of the cosmos. The utopian view is that of different species living in harmony with each other. This book emphasises social/ecological justice, intersectionality and relationality as the targets for Adult Education in this relatively still new millennium.

It treats philosophy as not a collection of systems, but as a study of problems. It recognizes in traditional philosophical systems the historical function of having asked questions rather than having given solutions. Professor Reichenbach traces the failures of the systems to psychological causes. Speculative philosophers offered answers at a time when science had not yet provided the means to give true answers. Their search for certainty and for moral directives led them to accept pseudo-solutions. Plato, Descartes, Spinoza, Kant, and many others are cited to illustrate the rationalist fallacy: reason, unaided by observation, was regarded as a source of knowledge, revealing the physical world and \"moral truth.\" The empiricists could not disprove this thesis, for they could not give a valid account of mathematical knowledge. Mathematical discoveries in the early nineteenth century cleared the way for modern scientific philosophy. Its advance was furthered by discoveries in modern physics, chemistry, biology, and psychology. These findings have made possible a new conception of the universe and of the atom. The work of scientists thus altered philosophy completely and brought into being a philosopher with a new attitude and training. Instead of dictating so-called laws of reason to the scientist, this modern philosopher proceeds by analyzing scientific methods and results. He finds answers to the age-old questions of space, time, causality, and life; of the human observer and the external world. He tells us how to find our way through this world without resorting to unjustifiable beliefs or assuming a supernatural origin for moral standards. Philosophy thus is no longer a battleground of contradictory opinions, but a science discovering truth step by step. Professor Reichenbach, known for his many contributions to logic and the philosophy of science, addresses this book to a wider audience. He writes for those who do not have the leisure or preparation to read in the fields of mathematics, symbolic logic, or physics. Besides showing the principal foundations of the new philosophy, he has been careful to provide the necessary factual background. He has written a philosophical study, not a mere popularization. It contains within its chapters all the necessary scientific material in an understandable form—and, therefore, conveys all the information indispensable to a modern world-view.

Peperzak\'s examination begins with a general overview of Levinas\'s life and thought, and shows how issues of ethics, politics, and religion are intertwined in Levinas\'s philosophy.

However, the implications of this emphasis for professional education programs have been underdeveloped. In this volume, philosophers, philosophers of education, and ethics educators engaged in a variety of professional contexts in Canada, the UK, Norway, Malta, and Sweden assess the state of ethics education and the role, if any, of philosophical approaches to ethics for those professional contexts. This volume speaks to teacher, medical, and business education, and the education of school psychologists. Each of these fields has its own context, aims and expertise, generating distinctive ethical challenges. As such, ethics curricula cannot be uncritically transplanted from one professional context to another. Nonetheless, the arguments and analyses in this volume point to a shared concern about the role of moral respect, self-understanding, and virtue in the education of professionals. The chapters examine a wide range of topics, including empirical ethics, core concepts in professional ethics, moral agency, the ethics of ethics education, risk-taking, professional ethics as a practice with its own ethical requirements, and the tensions between the individual (client, patient, student) and the increasing generalization of professional systems.

It particularly focuses on the content under the heading Ethics. It is common knowledge that many teachers find these parts difficult to handle within RE. Further, ethics is a field that addresses a range of moral and existential issues that are not easily treated. Many of these issues may be said to belong to the philosophical context, in which “eternal questions” are gathered and reflected upon. The first chapters highlight the concepts of ethical competence and critical thinking. In the following chapters the concept of ethical competence is analyzed with regard to teachers’ objectives and to students’ texts, respectively. These chapters pursue a more practice-related approach and highlight specific challenges identified from both teacher and student perspectives. Next, the book raises the issue of global responsibility. What kind of critical issues arise when handling such matters at school? Further, can contemporary moral philosophers contribute to such a discussion? In turn, the book discusses the role of statistical analyses with regard to national tests, while the closing chapters present international perspectives on the book’s main themes and concluding remarks. The book’s critical yet constructive approach to issues regarding assessment in ethics education makes a valuable contribution to an ongoing debate among researchers as well as to the everyday communication on testing in schools and classrooms. As such, it will appeal to scholars in ethics education and researchers in the field of assessment, as well as educators and teachers interested and engaged in the task of testing ethics in school contexts where curricular demands for valid and authoritative evaluation may provide important guidelines, but may also pose challenges of their own.','src/main/resources/com/chocopi/images/book/347.jpg','Education',3,1000000,'Olof Franck',2020,'Springer'),(348,'Food Ethics Education','The book is divided in 3 sections, each containing several chapters: Section 1 includes chapters that identify and discuss several ethical issues along the food chain, with particular detail of issues in the food industry and in consumer behavior; Section 2 includes chapters that present the basis of a code of conduct in the food profession as well as the description of existing codes of conduct of food industry and food scientist professionals, including ethics of publishing, and also ethics in risk communication; Section 3 includes chapters based on case studies with examples of teaching approaches currently used in teaching food ethics, easy to implement and already tested and confirmed as successful examples that engage students in this topic.

Người Thụy Điển dùng Lagom như kim chỉ nam cho cả dân tộc, hình thành nên phong cách sống, ứng xử giao tiếp và thậm chí cả ẩm thực của riêng mình. Là một phần lãnh thổ của Bắc Âu, xứ sở nổi tiếng với phong cách sống tối giản, Thụy Điển tự xây dựng cho mình một phong cách sống hoàn toàn khác, mang tên Lagom. Với tài sản văn hóa riêng này, người dân Thụy Điển luôn biết vừa lòng với những gì mình đang có và gần như không bao giờ so sánh với cuộc sống của người khác. “Lagom” là một tính từ dùng để chỉ sự vừa phải, không quá nhiều mà cũng chẳng quá ít. Thật khó để có thể chuyển tải hết ý nghĩa của từ lagom sang bất kỳ thứ tiếng nào khác. Người Thụy Điển dùng Lagom như “kim chỉ nam” chung cho cả dân tộc, hình thành nên phong cách sống, ứng xử, giao tiếp, và thậm chí cả ẩm thực của riêng mình. Lagom là vừa đủ, là thích hợp, là cân bằng nhưng không nhất thiết phải là hoàn hảo nhất. Như một giai thoại từ thế kỷ trước, nhiều người tin rằng từ này bắt nguồn từ thuật ngữ \"laget om\" của người Viking - nghĩa là \"chuyền quanh trong nhóm” xuất phát từ thói quen những người Viking. Vào thời đó, khi tất cả cùng ngồi quanh chiếc bàn và chuyền tay nhau những chiếc sừng đựng đầy rượu, mỗi người nhấp một ngụm vừa phải, làm sao để những người sau đó cũng có đủ rượu để thưởng thức. Trong một xã hội mà con người có thể tiếp cận với bất cứ thứ gì, vào bất cứ lúc nào thì Lagom giống như một cơn gió lạ. Sự hài lòng trong phong cách sống của người Thụy Điển không phải là vì họ có tất cả mọi thứ, mà đơn giản đó là một trạng thái thỏa mãn với những gì mình đang có. Lagom chính là việc thoát ra khỏi những bộn bề và cân đo đong đếm một cách thái quá. Tinh thần Lagom thể hiện ở mọi mặt của cuộc sống Thụy Điển, từ việc chỉ nói ngắn gọn vừa đủ không khoa trương, ở trong những ngôi nhà đơn giản ít đồ đạc và thoáng đãng, ăn những đồ ăn không quá cầu kỳ, thậm chí đến vui chơi cũng không quá ồn ào, náo nhiệt… Tất cả những điều đó đã tạo nên một phong cách sống tối giản nhưng mang lại sự bình an trong tâm hồn và hài hòa trong cuộc sống. Mang tập sách đến bạn đọc Việt Nam, mong rằng chúng ta đón nhận Lagom với một tinh thần và lối sống mới, biết vừa đủ với tất cả để cuộc sống bớt lại những gánh nặng, bộn bề. Từ đó bạn sẽ tìm được những bài học và lời khuyên để bắt đầu một lối sống Lagom. Đó có thể là những bài học về sự tiết chế và cân bằng, tìm sự cân bằng trong cuộc sống thường nhật để chúng ta có thể tìm được niềm vui tốt đẹp hơn, để từ đó có được những lợi ích cả về thể chất lẫn tinh thần cho bản thân, cũng như để cộng đồng và môi trường của chúng ta được cân bằng hơn nhờ vào lối sống của chúng ta. \"Không quá ít, không quá nhiều, chỉ vừa đủ\" nhưng biết như thế nào là đủ thì đó lại là giới hạn của mỗi người. Chỉ biết rằng, với người Thụy Điển, họ luôn biết cách làm hài lòng bản thân bằng những cột mốc riêng để làm sao vẫn đủ đầy cho bản thân nhưng không bị thái quá. Ít hơn, để có được nhiều hơn là vậy.

Bạn sẽ hiểu được nguồn gốc sự thật và những yếu tố quyết định thành công, thất bại để rồi áp dụng, thay đổi cách suy nghĩ, lên kế hoạch rồi tìm ra cách làm việc, đầu tư, sử dụng nguồn tài chính của bạn theo hướng hiệu quả nhất. Cuốn sách dành cho những ai còn loay hoay muốn tìm đường đến sự giàu có và thành công. “Bí mật tự duy triệu phú” mang đến nhiều tư duy mới cho người đọc về cách suy nghĩ của người giàu hay cách suy nghĩ để trở nên giàu có. Trong cuốn sách, Eker liệt kê 17 cách thức mà các kế hoạch chi tiết tài chính của những người giàu khác với người nghèo và tầng lớp trung lưu. Một chủ đề được xác định trong sách này là loại bỏ các suy nghĩ đổ lỗi cho sự thất bại. Eker lập luận rằng: Người giàu tin \"Tôi tạo ra cuộc sống của tôi\", còn những người nghèo cho rằng \"Cuộc sống sẽ tự nhiên đến với tôi\"; người giàu tập trung vào các cơ hội trong khi người nghèo tập trung vào những trở ngại; và những người giàu ngưỡng mộ những người giàu có và thành công khác trong khi người dân nghèo ghen tị, bực tức trước những người thành công và giàu có.

Our time is short and much must be done by the Body of Christ to make an impact and a difference on the earth. I firmly believe that as believers and individuals we need more personal development and a real understanding of true wealth. Wealth is not really about money, but rather the richness of our internal system which reveals who we are, our purpose in life, our gifts, talents, abilities and our God given assignment on earth. A truly wealthy person is a valuable and powerful vessel that is internally opulent and abundantly blessed. When we are wealthy we are overflowing with fulfillment, godly purpose, passion, delight and generosity. Jesus is our ultimate example and He said in John 10:10bAMP, I came that they may have and enjoy life, and have it in abundance,(to the full, till it over flows). This is the true definition of wealth and we are assigned and entrusted to be examples of it. In Working Wealth, you will learn all about wealth. You will be given the resources to assist you in your personal development building so you can be a witness of Gods wealth. Personal development is the key to becoming a truly wealthy individual with all fruitfulness, prosperity, success and effectiveness of a wealthy person. Thank you for investing in yourself by purchasing the Working Wealth. I can promise you that this book will be a very powerful tool and resource towards building a fulfilling, energizing, exciting and edifying lifestyle. I have found that every person wants to be better, more improved and more effective. Personal development is the key to reaching those dreams, goals and desires that speak on the inside of you. Why should you live in weakness and lack, when you are full of treasure? Jesus said, in Matthew 25:14-15, For it is like a man who was about to take a long journey and he called his servants together and entrusted them with his property. To one he gave five talents, to another two, to another one, to each according to his own personal ability. Then he departed and left the country. Personal development is taking seriously what has been entrusted to you and investing in it to produce a wealthy, more profitable you.','src/main/resources/com/chocopi/images/book/369.jpg','Self - help',3,1000000,'Dr. James E.

Have you ever wondered how highly successful people get things done without losing their sanity? Then you need to keep reading... “Until we can manage time, we can manage nothing else.” This famous quote rightly points out that every aspect of your life is determined by how you use your time. That’s because your life is made up of time. Time is your most precious commodity and it’s limited. Yet you may be easily losing time due to failure to manage it or by wasting it on unnecessary activities. On the other hand, you may be working hard and yet fail to achieve the desired results. This book will help you to master your time and conquer the results. Even for the most successful people, it’s a work in progress. Don’t feel bad if your time managing skills aren’t what they should be. The greatest names probably started off as you, but through self-discipline, they were able to succeed. Time management skills are the solution. They usually involve something simple, such as making a to-do list, or calculating how much time you waste on apps that are irrelevant to your work. Although they may seem too simple to work, you’ll be surprised at how much of a dent they can make.

Nếu bạn phải dừng lại và suy ngẫm về “những ưu tiên số một” trong đời – một vài điều bạn cho là quan trọng nhất – thì đó là những điều gì? Làm thế nào để xác định được chính xác “những điều quan trọng nhất” trong đời – những điều có vai trò quyết định đến chất lượng sống của bạn, mang đến cho bạn một cuộc sống thành đạt ngoài xã hội và yên bình trong nội tâm? Và liệu bạn có thực sự dành đủ sự quan tâm, sự tập trung và thời gian cho những điều ấy? Tư duy tối ưu giúp bạn trả lời tất cả những câu hỏi quan trọng đó! Hầu hết chúng ta đều luôn cảm thấy bị thiếu thời gian, luôn gặp khủng hoảng và mất cân bằng giữa công việc và cuộc sống cá nhân, luôn cảm thấy không biết mình nên làm việc này trước hay việc kia trước. Cuốn sách này trình bày một phương pháp quản trị thời gian hiệu quả nhất - quan điểm dựa vào nguyên tắc. Khác với phương pháp quản trị thời gian truyền thống rằng nếu làm việc với hiệu suất cao hơn, thì cuối cùng bạn sẽ kiểm soát được cuộc sống của mình và có cảm giác bình yên và thỏa mãn những điều bạn mong muốn; phương pháp này ưu việt hơn, giúp bạn quyết đoán khi hành động và điều quan trọng là nó phải là kết quả của quá trình tư duy kỹ càng, sâu lắng. Thay vì đưa cho bạn một chiếc đồng hồ khác, phương pháp này sẽ đem đến cho bạn một cái la bàn - vì rằng xác định đúng đích đến mới là điều quan trọng hơn so với việc bạn đi nhanh như thế nào. Qua cuốn sách chúng ta có thể tham khảo một số ví dụ từ cuộc sống, công việc và những cách giải quyết đã mang lại thành công tốt nhất. Để thu được hiệu quả nhất từ cuốn sách này, bạn nên đọc có chiều sâu - nghĩa là liên hệ với bản thân mình, với khuôn mẫu đã được dạy dỗ, với động cơ của mình, để xem đâu là “điều quan trọng nhất” đối với bạn, và bản thân bạn đại diện cho điều gì. Đây là một quá trình đấu tranh nội tâm ở mức cao. Một điều khuyên hữu ích khi đọc cuốn sách này là bạn nên dừng lại và lắng nghe tiếng nói từ cả khối óc lẫn con tim của mình. Khi đã thấm nhuần và hiểu sâu sắc về sự tự ý thức, bạn sẽ có sự thay đổi. Khi đó, bạn sẽ nhìn thế giới với đôi mắt khác. Bạn sẽ nhìn các mối quan hệ với cái nhìn khác. Bạn sẽ nhìn thời gian một cách khác. Bạn sẽ nhìn bản thân mình khác trước.

The concept of Self-Action Leadership (SAL) is rooted in 30 years of extensive research spanning the fields of self-leadership, leadership, action research, character education, and autoethnography. In addition to drawing on the scholarship of these extant fields, SAL simultaneously builds upon them by introducing an original theory and model that executives, administrators, scholars, teachers, and practitioners alike can universally utilize to their own advantages and to the benefit of their colleagues, subordinates, and students. Volume I—The Self-Action Leadership Theory—contains prefacing material for the combined texts. It also includes the first four book sections of the two volume set.','src/main/resources/com/chocopi/images/book/408.jpg','Self - help',3,1000000,'Jordan R.

This carefully developed and researched text will fill this gap by providing a succinct, modular and easy to comprehend introduction to the subject of financial management. The book has a total of 20 chapters that are divided into 6 units, which is less than other financial management texts that reflect the changing needs of tutors and students.

Being focused on the logical discussion, where it is needed for a contextual understanding of the topic, makes the book different from others.

Using narrative analysis of diaries and reminiscences of women who travelled 2,000+ miles on the Oregon Trail in the mid-to-late 1800s, Pompper uncovers how these women filled roles of Caretaker/Advocate, Community Builder of Meeting Houses and Schools, served a Civilizing Function, offered Agency and Leadership, and provided Emotional Connection for Social Cohesion.

March draws on research from all the disciplines of social and behavioral science to show decision making in its broadest context. By emphasizing how decisions are actually made -- as opposed to how they should be made -- he enables those involved in the process to understand it both as observers and as participants. March sheds new light on the decision-making process by delineating four deep issues that persistently divide students of decision making: Are decisions based on rational choices involving preferences and expected consequences, or on rules that are appropriate to the identity of the decision maker and the situation? Is decision making a consistent, clear process or one characterized by ambiguity and inconsistency? Is decision making significant primarily for its outcomes, or for the individual and social meanings it creates and sustains? And finally, are the outcomes of decision processes attributable solely to the actions of individuals, or to the combined influence of interacting individuals, organizations, and societies? March\'s observations on how intelligence is -- or is not -- achieved through decision making, and possibilities for enhancing decision intelligence, are also provided. March explains key concepts of vital importance to students of decision making and decision makers, such as limited rationality, history-dependent rules, and ambiguity, and weaves these ideas into a full depiction of decision making. He includes a discussion of the modern aspects of several classic issues underlying these concepts, such as the relation between reason and ignorance, intentionality and fate, and meaning and interpretation.

Contemporary fiction has immediate relevance to popular culture, the news, scholarly organizations, and education – where it is found on the syllabus in schools and universities – but it also offers challenges. What is ‘contemporary’? How do we track cultural shifts and changes? The Routledge Companion to Twenty-First Century Literary Fiction takes on this challenge, mapping key literary trends from the year 2000 onwards, as the landscape of our century continues to take shape around us. A significant and central intervention into contemporary literature, this Companion offers essential coverage of writers who have risen to prominence since then, such as Hari Kunzru, Jennifer Egan, David Mitchell, Jonathan Lethem, Ali Smith, A. L. Kennedy, Hilary Mantel, Marilynne Robinson, and Colson Whitehead. Thirty-eight essays by leading and emerging international scholars cover topics such as: • Identity, including race, sexuality, class, and religion in the twenty-first century; • The impact of technology, terrorism, activism, and the global economy on the modern world and modern literature; • The form and format of twenty-first century literary fiction, including analysis of established genres such as the pastoral, graphic novels, and comedic writing, and how these have been adapted in recent years. Accessible to experts, students, and general readers, The Routledge Companion to Twenty-First Century Literary Fiction provides a map of the critical issues central to the discipline, as well as uncovering new perspectives and new directions for the development of the field.

The question of ‘who writes Iran’ refers to a contested area which goes beyond the discipline of literary criticism. Non-literary discourses have made every effort to impose their \"committed\" readings on literary texts; they have even managed to exert influence on the process of literary creation. In this process, inevitably, many works, or segments of them, and many concepts which do not lend themselves to such readings have been ignored; at the same time, many of them have been appropriated by these discourses. Yet components and elements of Persian literary tradition have persistently engaged in this discursive confrontation, mainly by insisting on literature’s relative autonomy, so that at least concepts such as conformity and subterfuge, essential in terms of defining modern and modernist Persian fiction, could be defined in a literary manner. Proffering an alternative in terms of literary historiography; this book supports a methodological approach that considers literary narratives which occur in the margins of dominant discourses, and indeed promote non-discursivity, as the main writers of Persian modernist fiction. It is an essential resource for scholars and researchers interested in Persian and comparative literature, as well as Middle Eastern Studies more broadly.','src/main/resources/com/chocopi/images/book/466.jpg','Fiction',3,1000000,'Mohammad Khorrami',2016,'Routledge'),(467,'The Great Gatsby','English-Vietnamese bilingual edition of the great American modern classic The Great Gatsby.

These were the days of the youth of science fiction, when it was brash, raw and exciting: the days of the first great space operas by Edward Elmer Smith and Edmond Hamilton, through the cosmic thought variants by Murray Leinster, Jack Williamson and others to the early 1940s when John W. Campbell at Astounding did his best to nurture the infant genre into adulthood. Under him such major names as Robert A. Heinlein, Isaac Asimov, A. E. van Vogt and Theodore Sturgeon emerged who, along with other such new talents as Ray Bradbury and Arthur C. Clarke, helped create modern science fiction.

Several selections address current political-social issues, like Mary Rosenblum\'s \"Search Engine,\" which extrapolates today\'s technology to chilling, Big Brotherly results. The long closing story, Alastair Reynolds\'s \"Understanding Space and Time,\" however, presents a ray of cosmic hope: the sole survivor of a plague that decimated humanity is rescued and healed by intergalactic entities and lives out millennia while seeking ultimate truths, returning to see mankind regenerated.

The horror film’s pop-culture importance is undeniable, from its early influences to today’s most significant and exciting developments in the genre. Since 1990, the production of horror films has risen exponentially worldwide, resulting in impressive ticket sales in the modern day, not to mention how the genre has expanded into books, fashion, music, and other media throughout the world. Horror has long been the most popular film genre, and more horror movies have been made than any other kind. We need them.

But why do they captivate us so? What is the drive to be frightened, and why is it so perennially popular? Why Horror Seduces addresses these questions through evolutionary social sciences. Explaining the functional seduction of horror entertainment, this book draws on cutting-edge findings in the evolutionary social sciences, showing how the horror genre is a product of human nature. Integrating the study of horror with the sciences of human nature, the book claims that horror entertainment works by targeting humans\' adaptive tendency to find pleasure in make-believe, allowing a high intensity experience within a safe context. Through analyses of well-known and popular modern American works of horror--Rosemary\'s Baby; The Shining; I Am Legend; Jaws; and several others--author Mathias Clasen illustrates how these works target evolved cognitive and emotional mechanisms; we are attracted to horrifying entertainment because we have an adaptive tendency to find pleasure in make-believe that allows us to experience negative emotions at high levels of intensity within a safe context. Organized into three parts identifying fictional works by evolutionary mode--the evolution of horror; evolutionary interpretations of horror; the future of horror--Why Horror Seduces succinctly explores the cognitive processes behind spectators\' need to scream.','src/main/resources/com/chocopi/images/book/505.jpg','Fiction',3,1000000,'Mathias Clasen',2011,'Oxford University Press'),(506,'New Israeli Horror','Before 2010, there were no Israeli horror films. Then distinctly Israeli serial killers, zombies, vampires, and ghosts invaded local screens. The next decade saw a blossoming of the genre by young Israeli filmmakers. New Israeli Horror is the first book to tell their story. Through in-depth analysis, engaging storytelling, and interviews with the filmmakers, Olga Gershenson explores their films from inception to reception. She shows how these films challenge traditional representations of Israel and its people, while also appealing to audiences around the world. Gershenson introduces an innovative conceptual framework of adaptation, which explains how filmmakers adapt global genre tropes to local reality. It illuminates the ways in which Israeli horror borrows and diverges from its international models. New Israeli Horror offers an exciting and original contribution to our understanding of both Israeli cinema and the horror genre.

In State Violence and Moral Horror, Jeremy Arnold critically engages a wide variety of arguments, both canonical and contemporary, arguing that there can be no justification. Drawing on the concept of singularity found in the work of French philosopher Jean-Luc Nancy, Arnold demonstrates that any attempt to justify state violence will itself be violent and, therefore, must fail as a justification. On the basis of this argument, the book explores the concept of \"moral horror\" as the experience of living amidst and acquiescing to unjustifiable state violence. The careful explanation of arguments from across the spectrum of political theory and exceptionally clear prose will enable both advanced undergraduates and more general readers interested in political thought to understand and engage the central argument. State Violence and Moral Horror is a unique contribution to the growing literature on violence and will be of interest to political theorists and philosophers in both the analytic and continental traditions, philosophers of law, international relations theorists, law and society scholars, and social scientists interested in normative aspects of state violence.','src/main/resources/com/chocopi/images/book/508.jpg','Fiction',3,1000000,'Jeremy Arnold',2009,'State University of New York Press'),(509,'Joss Whedon vs. the Horror Tradition','Although ostensibly presented as “light entertainment,” the work of writer-director-producer Joss Whedon takes much dark inspiration from the horror genre to create a unique aesthetic and perform a cultural critique. Featuring monsters, the undead, as well as drawing upon folklore and fairy tales, his many productions both celebrate and masterfully repurpose the traditions of horror for their own means. Woofter and Jowett\'s collection looks at how Whedon revisits existing feminist tropes in the \'70s and \'80s “slasher” craze via Buffy the Vampire Slayer to create a feminist saga; the innovative use of silent cinema tropes to produce a new fear-laden, film-television intertext; postmodernist reflexivity in Cabin in the Woods; as well as exploring new concepts on “cosmic dread” and the sublime for a richer understanding of programmes Dollhouse and Firefly. Chapters provide the historical context of horror as well as the particular production backgrounds that by turns support, constrain or transform this mode of filmmaking. Informed by a wide range of theory from within philosophy, film studies, queer studies, psychoanalysis, feminism and other fields, the expert contributions to this volume prove the enduring relevance of Whedon\'s genre-based universe to the study of film, television, popular culture and beyond.','src/main/resources/com/chocopi/images/book/509.jpg','Fiction',4,1000000,'Kristopher Karl Woofter',2004,'Bloomsbury Publishing'),(510,'British Horror Cinema','British Horror Cinema investigates a wealth of horror filmmaking in Britain, from early chillers like The Ghoul and Dark Eyes of London to acknowledged classics such as Peeping Tom and The Wicker Man.

Scandinavian Crime Fiction identifies distinct features and changes in the Scandinavian crime tradition through analysis of some of its most well-known writers: Henning Mankell, Stieg Larsson, Anne Holt, Liza Marklund, Leena Lehtolainen, and Arnaldur Indriðason, among others. Focusing on Scandinavian crime fiction’s snowballing prominence since the 1990s, articles zoom in on the transformation of the genre’s social criticism, study the significance of cultural and geographical place in the tradition, and analyze the cultural politics of crime fiction, including struggles over gender equity, sexuality, ethnicity, history, and the fate of the welfare state. Scandinavian Crime Fiction maps out the contribution of Scandinavian crime writers to contemporary European culture and society, making the volume valuable to scholars and the interested public.','src/main/resources/com/chocopi/images/book/545.jpg','Fiction',5,1000000,'Paula Arvas',2000,'University of Wales Press'),(546,'Class and Culture in Crime Fiction','The crime fiction world of the late 1970s, with its increasingly diverse landscape, is a natural beginning for this collection of critical studies focusing on the intersections of class, culture and crime--each nuanced with shades of gender, ethnicity, race and politics. The ten new essays herein raise broad and complicated questions about the role of class and culture in transatlantic crime fiction beyond the Golden Age: How is \"class\" understood in detective fiction, other than as a socioeconomic marker? Can we distinguish between major British and American class concerns as they relate to crime? How politically informed is popular detective fiction in responding to economic crises in Scotland, Ireland, England and the United States? When issues of race and gender intersect with concerns of class and culture, does the crime writer privilege one or another factor?

Titillation is at the centre of narratives reliant upon discovery and revelation: motives and criminals are slowly revealed, along with sexualized and violated bodies – from femmes fatales to the corpses of victims. A satisfying, gratifying genre for its readership, the detective novel promises the disruption and subsequent restoration of order in societies tarnished by disillusionment which hope for a better future. This book takes as its focus examples of detective fiction from Cuba and Mexico during or in the aftermath of huge social upheaval (the Special Period and the War on Drugs), analyzing representations of sexualities, bodies, and the genre itself. Through an investigation of novels by Leonardo Padura and Amir Valle of Cuba, and Bef and Rogelio Guedea of Mexico, this work investigates increasingly fluid sexualities and bodies in challenging examples of metaphysical detective fiction, a particularly anxious subgenre which challenges both the structures and limits of the detective novel and the reader’s understanding of true and false and right and wrong, representative of troubling periods of severe social disruption for Cuba and Mexico.','src/main/resources/com/chocopi/images/book/547.jpg','Fiction',5,1000000,'Ailsa Peate',2001,'Liverpool University Press'),(548,'The Cuckoo\'s Calling','Vietnamese version of the very popular adult debut mystery/detective novel by Robert Galbraith, a.k.a J.

Essays reclaim detective fiction as an object of critical inquiry, examining the ways it shapes issues of social destabilization, moral ambiguity, reader complicity, intertextuality, and metafiction. Breaking new ground by moving beyond the critical preoccupation with classification of historical types and generic determinants, contributors examine the effect of mystery on literary forms and on readers, who experience the provocative, complex process of coming to grips with the unknown and the unknowable. This volume opens up discussion on publically acclaimed, modern works of mystery and on classic pieces, addressing a variety of forms including novels, plays, graphic novels, television series, films, and ipad games. Re-examining the interpretive potential of a genre that seems easily defined yet has endless permutations, the book closely analyzes the cultural function of mystery, the way it intervenes in social and political problems, as well as the literary properties that give the genre its particular shape. The volume treats various texts as meaningful subjects for critical analysis and sheds new light on the interpretive potential for a genre that creates as much ambiguity as it does clarity. Scholars of mystery and detective fiction, crime fiction, genre studies, and cultural studies will find this volume invaluable.','src/main/resources/com/chocopi/images/book/549.jpg','Fiction',4,1000000,'Casey Cothran',2023,'Routledge'),(550,'The Dry','INSTANT NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER \"A breathless page-turner, driven by the many revelations Ms. Harper dreams up...You\'ll love [her] sleight of hand...A secret on every page.\" --The New York Times \"One of the most stunning debuts I\'ve ever read...

Twenty years ago when Falk was accused of murder, Luke was his alibi. Falk and his father fled under a cloud of suspicion, saved from prosecution only because of Luke\'s steadfast claim that the boys had been together at the time of the crime. But now more than one person knows they didn\'t tell the truth back then, and Luke is dead. Amid the worst drought in a century, Falk and the local detective question what really happened to Luke.

Contending a conceptual and social reality of a combined \'art/culture\', this book demonstrates that the failure to appreciate the dynamic totality of art and culture by its purported negators is due to almost all existing critiques of art and culture being defences of a \'true\' art or culture against \'inauthentic\' manifestations, and art thus ultimately restricting creativity to the service of the bourgeois commodity regime. While the evidence that art/culture enables commodification has long been available, the deduction that art/culture itself is fundamentally of the world of commodification has failed to gain traction. By applying a nuanced analysis of both commodification and the larger systems of ideological power, the book considers how the \'surplus\' of art/culture is used to legitimate the bourgeois status quo rather than unravel it. It also examines possibilities for a post-art/culture world based on both existing practices that challenge art/culture identity as well as speculations on the integration of play and aesthetics into general social life.

True culture reflects the values that support human life; empathy, kindness, charity, patience, humility, compassion, character, honesty, a sense of honor, a work ethic, and a healthy love of life. Today, what poses as culture in our society - Drama to be exact, is not culture, but in fact, the absence of culture. Several professional and governmental organizations are listed as having stated that much of what is on television today is actually harmful to the mental health and well being of our citizens. So the issue of T.V. violence, which is traditionally presented as a controversial issue, is presented here as not a controversial issue, but in fact a well documented phenomenon of which a full consensus view in the social sciences has already occurred, and long ago.

Many years later, I encouraged my wife to be, to study art. She eventually became an incredible artist.

My wife was a night nurse, and her schedule was very heavy, and was conflicting with her life as an Artist. One night I came to the conclusion that if there was going to be any new art in the world which met with my particular taste, that I would have to make it myself.

By using the survey data covering 24 Indian states including the National Capital Region of Delhi (NCR), it will serve as State barometers of public opinion. The surveys seek to understand how politics and governance processes are nested in the social and political relationships between citizens inter se and with government functionaries. The book explores citizen perceptions about the social and political universes they inhabit in periods between elections. It examines social attitudes of citizens, friendship ties across social groups, gender roles and relationships; opinions on governance, ease of public service access, the citizen-state interface, and trust in political institutions; and, political attitudes and identity, nationalism, freedom of expression, and populism. This book explores public perceptions of everyday development and governance outcomes that are shaped by how the government functions between elections: how it relates to citizens on a regular basis; how it provides routine public services to them; and how public order is maintained.

Part of the water supplied to this area is consumed by the irrigated crop; the remainder of the supplied water drains to the groundwater basin, to downstream depressions, or back to the rivers. During its use, however, this drained part of the water accumulates salts and chemicals. The disposal of this polluted water causes a variety of (environmental) problems. If the percentage consumed water of the total water supply to an irrigated area (the so-called overall consumed ratio) can be increased, less water needs to be drained. This alleviates part of the related (environmental) problems. Further, if the overall consumed ratio for the above 7. 5 million hectare is improved, less water needs to be diverted from the rivers. Hence, more water can flow towards the Aral Sea. As mentioned above, part of the non-consumed irrigation water drains to the groundwater basin. Commonly, the natural discharge capacity of this basin is insufficient to handle this imported water. As a result, the groundwater table rises towards the land surface causing waterlogging. In (semi-)arid zones this waterlogging triggers a soil salinity problem resulting to a significant reduction in crop yields. The artificial increase of the discharge capacity, and lowering of the groundwater table, solves the soil salinity problem.','src/main/resources/com/chocopi/images/book/578.jpg','Others',3,1000000,'M.G.

People are exposed to these unintentional environmental contaminants primarily through the food supply, although at low levels, particularly by eating animal fat in meat, dairy products, and fish. While the amount of DLCs in the environment has declined since the late 1970s, the public continues to be concerned about the safety of the food supply and the potential adverse health effects of DLC exposure, especially in groups such as developing fetuses and infants, who are more sensitive to the toxic effects of these compounds. Dioxins and Dioxin-like Compounds in the Food Supply: Strategies to Decrease Exposure, recommends policy options to reduce exposure to these contaminants while considering how implementing these options could both reduce health risks and affect nutrition, particularly in sensitive and highly exposed groups, if dietary changes are suggested.','src/main/resources/com/chocopi/images/book/583.jpg','Others',3,1000000,'Institute of Medicine',2017,'National Academies Press'),(584,'The State of Food Insecurity in Lusaka, Zambia','The Lusaka urban food security survey done by AFSUN as part of its baseline survey of 11 Southern African cities found that up to 93% of the households in the informal settlements, which house three-quarters of the Zambian capital’s population, were food insecure. A paltry 8% were food secure. Worse still, most of the households in the informal urban settlements of Lusaka did not only have poor access to food, they also consumed foods from a very narrow range of food groups. Their diets were dominated by cereals and therefore likely to be deficient in essential vitamins, minerals and proteins. The AFSUN survey shows clearly that urban households obtain their food mainly through the market and therefore stable macro-economic conditions are essential to their food security. Since urban household food security is positively associated with levels of income, promotion of decent employment is critical. Among the urgent measures AFSUN recommends to address Lusaka’s food insecurity are the promotion by government of decent employment, including labour-intensive public works programmes that would stimulate formal employment, and supplementary feeding programmes in clinics and schools.','src/main/resources/com/chocopi/images/book/584.jpg','Others',5,1000000,'Mulenga, Chileshe',2015,'Southern African Migration Programme'),(585,'Modern Food Microbiology','With thirty revised and updated chapters the new edition of this classic text brings benefits to professors and students alike who will find new sections on many topics concerning modern food microbiology.

It is generally assumed to be an axiom by both nonprofessionals and professionals alike, that the most developed countries, through their intricate and complex standards, formal trainings and inspections, are always capable of providing much safer food items and beverages to consumers as opposed to the lesser developed countries and regions of the world. Clearly, the available data regarding the morbidity and the mortality in different areas of the world confirms that in developing countries, the prevalence and the incidence of presumptive foodborne illness is much greater. However, other factors need to be taken into consideration in this overall picture: First of all, one of the key issues in developing countries appears to be the availability of safe drinking water, a key element in any food safety strategy. Second, the availability of healthcare facilities, care providers, and medicines in different parts of the world makes the consequences of foodborne illness much more important and life threatening in lesser developed countries than in most developed countries. It would be therefore ethnocentric and rather simplistic to state that the margin of improvement in food safety is only directly proportional to the level of development of the society or to the level of complexity of any given national or international standard. Besides standards and regulations, humans as a whole have evolved and adapted different strategies to provide and to ensure food and water safety according to their cultural and historical backgrounds. Our goal is to discuss and to compare these strategies in a cross-cultural and technical approach, according to the realities of different socio-economic, ethnical and social heritages.','src/main/resources/com/chocopi/images/book/587.jpg','Others',4,1000000,'Aleardo Zaccheo',2017,'Springer'),(588,'Natural Baby Food','The complete guide to making all-natural, healthy baby food right in your own home—featuring over 150 nutritious recipes When it comes to planning a healthy diet for your child, Natural Baby Food removes the guesswork, ensuring that your baby gets the nutrition they need and develops healthy eating habits that will benefit them for years to come.

Thanks to improved techniques for examining data from multiple viewpoints, archaeologists are now in a position to choose to record different kinds of data and to explore that data more fully than ever before. The growing availability of computer networks and other technologies means that communication will become increasingly open and available to archaeologists in all parts of the world. Will this result in the democratization of archaeological knowledge on a global basis? For the first time, archaeology practiced with technical developments can be contrasted with archaeology undertaken in relative technological isolation. Archaeology and the Information Agedeals not only with technologies like solid modeling, videodisc, hypertext and expert systems as used in archaeology, but also with topics such as the use of information technology to integrate large scale research in East Africa, and the dissemination of the cultural practice of Tibetan art.
